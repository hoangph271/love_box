`#love_box`

An `Embedded Rust` attempt to create something small, lovely and useful...! :"}  

```js
 __________
| ________ | // - It's a Pico W
|| Lovely || // - With two buttons
|| #Texts || //   - `x` for `#Xiss`
||________|| //   - `o` for `#Okay`
|   x  o   |
|__________|

/* The Screen is for lovely texts stored somewhere,  
on the blockchain...? */
```

## TODOs:
- [ ] To power it...?
- [ ] Try [uasyncio](https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.19.1/library/uasyncio.html?highlight=uasyncio)

## DONEs:
- [x] fetch & store APs
- [x] Join new APs - ___how about hosting your own AP when NOT connected___...?
- [x] Caching mechanism for *lovely texts* - [btree](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/btree.html)...!
- [x] Not having a Pico W...!
- [x] ~~`Rust` or~~ `Python` - much more easier, also to learn...?
