`#love_box`

An `Embedded Rust` attempt to create something small, lovely and useful...! :"}  

```js
 __________
| ________ | // - It's a Pico W
|| Lovely || // - With two buttons
|| #Texts || //   - `x` for `#Xiss`
||________|| //   - `o` for `#Okay`
|   x  o   |
|__________|

/* The Screen is for lovely texts stored somewhere,  
on the blockchain...? */
```

## Issues:
- [ ] Join new APs...?
- [ ] How to power it...?
- [x] Caching mechanism for *lovely texts* - just use files...!
- [x] Not having a Pico W...!
- [x] ~~`Rust` or~~ `Python` - much more easier, also to learn...?
